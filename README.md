# Python Calculator CI Practice

## Tools

- Python Modules
  - **[Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)** Linting: check if your code conforms to the standard Python coding style

  - **[Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)** unit testing: check a single function, or unit, of code

  - **Pytest-cov** calculating code coverage: code coverage is the percentage of source code that is “covered” by your tests

- External CI Server: [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)
